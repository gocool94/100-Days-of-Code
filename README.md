#  100 Days of code

100 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

After several failed attempts, # I'm coming back by publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today!

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:

1) Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2) Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

My Exceptions:

If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
few emergencies demands to take a day off
